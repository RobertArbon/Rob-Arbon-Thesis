This thesis describes the use of Markov models to describe the conformational and configurational dynamics of two systems and different ends of the complexity scale: water moving through an organic matrix and the conformational landscape of aromatic amine dehdyrogenase (AADH). 

\textbf{From art to science:} 
MSMs are master equations (ME review [6])
Model is n x n matrix, spans the conformational space, conditional probabilities as elements. 
State populations are give thermodynamics, off-diagonal elements give kinetics. 
If we assume thermodynamic equilibrium then eigendecomposition is useful [description of eigenvectors]
the n states should capture the dyanmics. 

Memoryless transition networks come from Zwanzig [1] then Van Kampen [2] key MSM papers [7-9]. 

creating meaningful states is difficult [33,34] Karpen did dihedrals [10] de Groot [20] did PCA and k-medioids.

can stitch together different trajectories: McCammon [11] now Folding@home [35], Luty [12] suggested stitching together different trajs for ligand binding. 

Hardware devs: FoldingAtHome, BlueGened [39-41], GPUGRID [43,44]

ITS plots [9] CKtest [46]

Different features different dynamics [45]

Errors are (1) state decomposition and (2) finite sampling [47]

Global descriptors worse than internal degrees of freedom [49]

Sarich [73, 92]: discretization error decreases and partitioning become finer and the lag time increases. 

Djurdjevac [93]: upper bounds for error between MSM and trajectories decreases with lag time. 

TICA\c variance explained [115]:
This MSM score was termed the GMRQ, which stands for
generalized matrix Rayleigh quotient, the form of the approx-imator (also referred to as the Rayleigh trace).124
The GMRQ on the validation set will be poor if the model was overfit on the
training set but better if the model identifies the underlying
dynamics common to both sets. In 2016, Noé and Clementi115 demonstrated that kinetic variance in a data set can be explained area.
by summing the squared tICA eigenvalues. Since the variational principle derived in Noé and Nüske95 holds for any strictly nonincreasing weights applied to the scored eigenvalues,96 the kinetic variance can also be used to score models, or to deter- mine how many tICs are needed to explain a given amount of kinetic variance in the data.
