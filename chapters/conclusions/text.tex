\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chap:conclusions}


The contributions of this thesis have been further demonstrate the scope of MMs and to introduce a number of ideas from the worlds of machine learning and mixture models to improve the MM analysis pipeline. 

Chapter \ref{chap:water} demonstrated the use of MMs to explain deviations to the Stoke-Einstein (S-E) equation of water diffusion in a sucrose matrix. The natural MSM basis set to answer this question was the cartesian coordinates of the water molecule. This did not require variatonal optimisation of the kind described in chapter \ref{chap:msm} and meant that the modelling could be done at scale - 8000 different MSMs were estimated and used to partition, classify and analyse the MD data. The results showed that \SI{11.8}{\percent} of the time the water was trapped in cavities defined by the sucrose matrix undergoing reversible hopping dynamics with an average barrier height of \num{6.42}$k_{B}T$. 

To develop this work further a number of improvements and extensions can be made. First, the proportion of time spent in local equilibria could be refined by more accurately partitioning each MD trajectory into reversible/non-reversible sections. Instead of a single sucrose position decorrelation time (which determined the \SI{1}{\nano\second} time-slices used in chapter \ref{chap:water}), a local estimate can be used by averaging the autocorrelation function over small range of values $t-\Delta t < t < t+\Delta t$:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{R}_{X,  X}(t^{\prime})=\mathbb{E}_{t \in [t\pm\Delta t]}\left[X_{t} \bar{X}_{t+t^{\prime}}\right]
\end{equation}
and choosing the longest time such that $\mathrm{R}_{X,  X}(t^{\prime}) > 0.8$ (or some other threshold). Second, using this more accurate partition, the irreversible timescales could be estimated using Koopman models \cite{wuVariationalApproachLearning2019}. With both sets of timescales estimated a more mathematically precise comaparison of the S-E and cavity dynamics model can be made. Third, using more complex basis sets involving water-sucrose bonds lengths and relative orientations could be  variationally  optimised using the methods of chapter \ref{chap:msm}, potentially shedding more light on the microscopic mechanism of transport between the cavities. 

Chapter \ref{chap:msm} demonstrated how to use Bayesian optimisation of model hyperparameters for an MSM of alanine dipeptide, a technique common in machine learning. Specifically, a Gaussian processes (GP) regression was used to model the response surface of an MSM with respect to its hyperparameters and Bayesian optimisation used to optimise the number of microstates, $n$ and the continuous feature, $\chi$, in basis set construction. Over the range of hyperparameters tested the number of microstates was shown to be irrelevant, compared to continuous feature, in determining the VAMP-2 score. Both the $(\phi, \psi)$ dihedral angles \emph{and} the heavy atom positions captured the slow relaxation processes equally well. Bayesian optimisation was then used to optimise the hyperparameters and it was shown that $50$ seed observations was needed to initialise the Bayesian optimisation algorithm. 

The main limitation of this study is that the response surface was unrealistically simple and did not provide adequate variation to test the Bayesian optimisation algorithm (proven in other studies \cite{bergstraAlgorithmsHyperParameterOptimizationa}\cite{bergstrajamesbergstraRandomSearchHyperParameter2012}.  In addition, the relevance of the number of microstates, $n$, was not in line with other studies \cite{mcgibbonStatisticalModelSelection2014a}\cite{wuVariationalApproachLearning2020c}\cite{mcgibbonVariationalCrossvalidationSlow2015}. To improve this,  the search space of $n$ should be shifted from $[10, 1000]$ to $[2, 100]$. This would allow meaningful variation in the VAMP-2 score with respect to both $n$ and $\chi$.  Using this new hyperparameter search space, the demonstration of Bayesian optimisation and the test of the number of required seed observations could be improved by: i) increasing the number of BO steps from \num{10} to \num{100}, or until convergence in the response surface, and ii) repeating the optimisation a larger number of times to gain a statistical insight into its efficacy, and a more generalizable estimate of the number of seed observations. The workflow of this chapter could be applied to the 12 fast folding proteins  \cite{lindorff-larsenHowFastFoldingProteins2011a}. This would extend and refine the work of \cite{husicOptimizedParameterSelection2016} which used the GMRQ to elucidate a set of principles for MSM construction. Working with a set of well-converged protein simulations would increase the generalizability of the conclusions about hyperparameter relevance, and provide a more robust test of Bayesian optimisation than alanine dipeptide.  To extend this work futher and bring statistical modelling of bimolecular systems ever closer to machine learning best practice, the use of response surface models which take into account conditional hyperparameter search spaces such as TPEs or RFs could by used.

Chapter \ref{chap:hmm} drew on ideas from the mixture model community to demonstrate the use of the integrated classification likelihood (ICL) and other information criteria in determining  the appropriate number of hidden states in a HMM.  The benefits of these type of model selection metrics are that they are easy to calculate and do not rely on being able to resolve clear gaps in the eigenvalue spectrum. The ICL was able to correctly determine the number of metastable states in an HMM of the four well Prinz potential for \num{3} out of \num{5} lag times tested, while selecting only one extra state the remaining \num{2} lag times. The remaining criteria overestimated the number  hidden states by a considerable margin. The main limitation of this work is the limited amount of  benchmarking. A number of further steps are needed to gain a better estimate of the generalizability of the ICL. First, bootstrap the simulation data and calculate the selected number of hidden states on each bootstrap sample. This would give probabilities of the each criteria selecting the correct number of states, rather than the current single point estimates. Second, and still using the Prinz potential simulation data, calculate performance of each criteria with differing amounts of data. This would allow the performance of each criteria under the more realistic condition of limited data to be assessed. Third, more benchmark systems are needed, both `toy' models with well defined numbers of metastable states e.g. the 2D triple well from \cite{noeProjectedHiddenMarkov2013a}, the model 2D potential in \cite{bacalladoBayesianComparisonMarkov2009a} used to benchmark Bayes factors for MSMs, and M{\"u}ller potential in the AIC and BIC benchmarking in \cite{mcgibbonStatisticalModelSelection2014a}. In addition, standard molecular benchmarks such alanine dipeptide, the Villin headpiece and $\beta$-lactamase (used in \cite{bowmanQuantitativeComparisonAlternative2013}) and the Fip35WW (used in \cite{mcgibbonStatisticalModelSelection2014a}).  

Chapter \ref{chap:aadh} used the response surface and BO methods from chapter \ref{chap:msm} and the model selection techniques of chapter \ref{chap:hmm} to create a HMM of the active site of AADH. A simulation data set of AADH was created and the response surface using an expanded set of hyperparameters was estimated and optimised. A number of sensitivity models were suggested from inspection of the optimised response surface. HMMs were estimated using the number of hidden states suggested by the ICL. The most relevant parameters for determining the VAMP-2 score were the TICA lag time and the least relevant the number of microstates.  The optimal continuous feature was the backbone and residue dihedral angles. Coarse graining the optimal MSM using a Bayesian HMM and choosing the number of hidden states with the ICL revealed a complex network of states. The slowest relaxation process of approximately \SI{1}{\micro\second} involved transport between two unreactive states through a flux bottleneck state. This bottle neck state had the shortest average donor-acceptor distance and was thus deemed the most `reactive'. The second sensitivity test (and the only sensitivity test to converge a HMM) did not confirm these results and showed a qualitatively different story albeit with similar relaxation timescales. Due to the effective lack of data, neither of the HMMs could be validated. This work failed to find evidence for the hypothesis of \cite{glowackiTakingOckhamRazor2012b} that there are two distinct, reactive conformational states. 

The main drawback of this work is the AADH data set which must be corrected and expanded before any inferences can be drawn. First, the mistake in the disulphide bond must corrected and the simulation cell re-equilibrated. Second, the sampling trajectories must be initialized from independent starting structures by minimizing and re-equilibrating structures taken from a seeding trajectory. Third, the source of the large conformational changes both in the loop structure adjacent to the active site and the tail residues must be investigated. This will ensure that the sampling is taking place in  conformations relevant for the rate determining reaction. The amount of simulation data should be determined by monitoring the convergence of implied timescale  for optimized MSMs (using the methods of chapter \ref{chap:msm}), or through an adaptive sampling method e.g., \cite{doerrOntheFlyLearningSampling2014}.
